A systemic network for ranked universal dependencies

This section explains the translation of anchors for verbs.

For an introduction to IP, see [the motivation for IP](IP.md).

## Verbs
There are 60 anchors for verbs ('aux' or 'verb') in the ITTB corpus of which 2/3 (42) happen for less than 1% of the verbs. Our goal is to reduce the number of anchors with frequency higher than 1% to under 10. To accommodate the relations between verbs, we shall cover five linguistic phenomena:

1. Auxiliaries versus process verbs 
2. Finitive versus infinitive verbs
3. Verb modes
4. Finite and non-finite clauses
5. Clause contacts

### Step 1

Let us start by focusing on verbal groups. As mentioned in the motivation of the IP description, one of our aims is to provide teachers with grammatical structures that are useful for teaching the options in meaning that authors encounter in Latin. These grammatical structures must be represented graphically on a computer screen and these graphic representations should highlight those similarities in wording that correspond to similarities in meaning. For instance, one aspect of verbal groups that students must master is that, usually, one verb represents a process in which people and other things take part while the other verbs are responsible for determining the subject, determining polarity (true, false), modulating the statement (possibly true, probably true, certainly true), and setting the time of this process relative to the time of interaction (happened, is happening, will happen). We say that the verb representing the process is the lexical verb and that the other verbs are its auxiliaries. Here is an example of the graphical representation we are aiming at.

non           |potest      |esse
:------------:|:----------:|:----------:
Adjunct       | Auxiliary  |Head

possibile est |non         |moveri
:------------:|:----------:|:----------:
Auxiliary     |Adjunct     |Head

impossibile est |esse
:--------------:|:----------:
Auxiliary       |Head

In the UD description, we do not have the necessary dependencies for a verbal group. Let us look into some examples of the mapping between syntagma and structure in the ITTB corpus, contrasting clauses where we find auxiliary verbs with those where there are none.

FORM        |quod        |in          |deo         |nihil       |potest      |esse        |violentum
:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:
WORD-CLASS  |sconj       |adp         |propn       |pron        |verb        |aux         |adj
STRUCTURE-1 |            |Case >      |Head        |            |            |Cop >       |Head
STRUCTURE-2 |Mark        |            |Obl         |Nsub        |Head        |            |Xcomp

The examples above read *that in God there is no flaw*, *that in God there can be no evil*, *that in God nothing is violent*, and *that in God nothing can be violent*. In UD terms, the finite verb is always the head of the clause. In existential clauses, the noun is the subject of the verb *est* only when it is finite. If a finite verb such as *potest* is inserted, it becomes the subject of that verb instead. The infinitive verb is an 'Xcomp' of the finite verb. As for attributive clauses, the adjective is the head of the clause if there are no finite verbs. The noun is its subject and the auxiliary is its copula. When a finite verb such as *potest* is inserted, the noun becomes its subject and the adjective becomes its 'Xcomp'. As we can see, there is very little stability between word classes and the anchors associated with them.

Taking this observation into consideration, I shall propose another structure and other word classes so as to forge a stability between class and function, thus increasing the number of rules that can be transferred between examples.

:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:
WORD-CLASS  |            |            |            |noun        |verb        |verb        |adjective
VERB-CLASS  |            |            |            |            |auxiliary   |lexical     |

In the new proposal, *non* (*no*), an **(adverb)**, always serves as an Adjunct for the **(lexical verb)**. In addition, *potest* (*can*), an **(auxiliary verb)**, always serves as an Auxiliary for the **(lexical verb)**. This creates a stable mapping between word classes and structure at the rank of groups. In turn, the verb *esse* may represent an existential process when it is followed by a **(noun)**, and it may represent an attributive process when it is preceded by a **(noun)** and followed by an **(adjective)**. Therefore, the mappings between the syntagma and the structure can be transferred between clauses with and without *potest*. The actual translation rules are provided in the `ittb-ip.dux` file.

In particular, there are auxiliary verbs such as *necesse est* and *possibile est*, which function like an attributive clause embedded in the verbal group. Here are the syntagmata and the structures according to UD and IP descriptions.

GROUP       |Deictic >   |Head        |            |            |Auxiliary > |Adjunct >   |Head
CLAUSE-2    |            |Goal        |            |            |            |            |Head

An IP analysis results in a more stable syntagma-structure mapping. Here we see an attributive clause embedded in a verbal group, which means we rank a clause *possibile est* down to the word rank, so that we can take it as an alternative option to the auxiliary verb *potest*. For this to be achieved, a small class of adjectives needs to be either manually created or automatically learned based on the lemmata. This class should include modal adjectives such as *possibile* (*possible*), *impossibile* (*impossible*), and *necesse* (*necessary*) as well as truth adjectives such as *verum* (*true*) and *falsum* (*false*).

There are four grammatical structures in this dependency tree and we can be represent them graphically in the following way: 

#### Groups

omne        |corpus
:----------:|:----------:
Deicitc     |Head

possibile est |non         |moveri
:------------:|:----------:|:----------:
Auxiliary     |Adjunct     |Head

#### Clauses

possibile   |est
:----------:|:----------:
Attribute   |Head

omne corpus             |possibile est non moveri
:----------------------:|:----------------------:
Goal                    |Head

The commands for translating an analysis from UD to IP as shown above can be found in the `ittb-ip.dux` file.

### Step 2 

Let us now move towards the other end of the verbal group and let us identify the last verb in that chain.

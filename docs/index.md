## Experiential functions

Experiential meaning is the way humans represent their experience, how they represent the way things are and how things change over time. In this sense, a good model of experiential meaning should account for the way people represent static and dynamic processes taking place in time.

In static processes, we have the things that exist, carriers of attributes and the attributes themselves. Attributes can be qualities (intrisic attributes), they can be things (possessive attributes), and they can be circumstances (circumstantial attributes).

Type        | Subtype        | Upper Role    | Lower Role               | Example
----------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------
existential | --             | Existent      | Existent                 | _there is **John**_
attributive | intrinsic      | Carrier       | quality Carrier          | _**John** is tall_
attributive | possessive     | Carrier       | possessing Carrier       | _**John** has a piano_
attributive | possessive     | Carrier       | possessed Carrier        | _**John** belongs to Team A_
attributive | circumstantial | Carrier       | circumstance Carrier     | _**John** is in town_
attributive | intrinsic      | Attribute     | intrinsic Attribute      | _John is **tall**_
attributive | possessive     | Attribute     | possessed Attribute      | _John has **a piano**_
attributive | possessive     | Attribute     | possessing Attribute     | _John belongs to **Team A**_
attributive | circumstantial | Attribute     | circumstantial Attribute | _John is **in town**_

In dynamic processes, there are two models: the transitive interpretation whereby the Actor is the entry point for description and the ergative interpretation where the Medium undergoing change is the entry point. Below, the upper participant roles belong to the transitive interpretation and the lower role includes the type of participation according to the type of state that is being modified, whether existential or attributive, and the type of attribute being modified, whether intrinsic, possessive, or circumstantial.

Type      | Subtype         | Subsubtype      | Upper Role    | Lower Role           | Example

material  | attributive     | possessive      | Actor         | taking Actor         | _**John** bought a piano_
material  | attributive     | possessive      | Actor         | giving Actor         | _**John** sold the piano_

material  | attributive     | possessive      | Goal          | giving Goal          | _John left **Team A**_
material  | attributive     | possessive      | Exchanger     | taking Exchanger     | _John sold the piano to **Mark**_
material  | attributive     | possessive      | Exchanger     | giving Exchanger     | _John bought the piano from **Mark**_
material  | attributive     | circumstantial  | Holder        | final Holder         | _John delivered the package to **Mark**_
material  | attributive     | circumstantial  | Holder        | initial Holder       | _John received the package from **Mark**_
material  | attributive     | circumstantial  | Range         | final Range          | _John entered **the house**_
material  | attributive     | circumstantial  | Range         | initial Range        | _John exited **the house**_
material  | attributive     | circumstantial  | Circumstance  | final Circumstance   | _John went **into the house**_
material  | attributive     | circumstantial  | Circumstance  | initial Circumstance | _John went **out of the house**_

These specific participant roles might have correspondents in other descriptions of experiential meaning such as Panini's karakas.

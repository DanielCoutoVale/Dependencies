NOTE: In this section, as in graphic representations of IP, the function of the Head in a clause shall be relabeled 'Process'.

### Step 1

### Step 2

The two main participants of a material process are the **Actor** and the **Goal**. We see them in clauses such as the following one: 

FORM        |hi          |vero        |neutrum     |recipiunt
:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:
WORD-CLASS  |noun        |adverb      |noun        |verb
CLAUSE      |Actor       |            |Goal        |Process

Goals are the aim of an action. They are that which is either created, affected, or destroyed. Created and destroyed goals correspond to existents in existential clauses whereas affected goals correspond to carriers in attributive clauses. For possessive attributes, there are two secondary participants. A goal can be received from a **Donor** and it can be given to a **Recipient** as shown below:

FORM        |quae        |homines     |de          |sapiente    |concipiunt
:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:

FORM        |cognitio    |maximam     |perfectionem|animae      |confert
